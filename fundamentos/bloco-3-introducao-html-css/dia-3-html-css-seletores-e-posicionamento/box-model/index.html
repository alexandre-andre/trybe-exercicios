                    Let's move on and have a look at some examples. Below we have three different HTML elements, all of which have an outer display type of block. The first is a paragraph, which has a border added in CSS. 
                    The browser renders this as a block box, so the paragraph begins on a new line, and expands to the full width available to it.
                    The second is a list, which is laid out using display: flex. This establishes flex layout for the items inside the container, however, the list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph — expands 
                    to the full container width and breaks onto a new line. Below this, we have a block-level paragraph, inside which are two span elements. 
                    These elements would normally be inline, however, one of the elements has a class of block, and we have set it to display: block.
